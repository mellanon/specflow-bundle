# SpecFlow Bundle

**Spec-Driven Development for AI Infrastructure**

---

## Why SpecFlow?

### The Promise vs The Reality

AI coding assistants promise "10x developer productivity" — just describe what you want and watch the code appear. The reality? A frustrating cycle:

![Promise vs Reality](docs/problem-promise-vs-reality.png)

**Copy → Paste → Fix → Repeat.** Hallucinated APIs. Lost context. Code that works once and breaks mysteriously. Every session starts from zero.

### The Insight

> **The AI is the same. The architecture around it isn't.**

The breakthrough isn't a better model — it's better scaffolding. When you give AI agents structure, constraints, and verification gates, they stop hallucinating and start engineering.

### Code is a Liability

[Cory Doctorow articulated](https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/06/1000x-liability/) what experienced developers know: **code is a liability, not an asset**. Every line requires maintenance. Every feature adds complexity. Probabilities are multiplicative — chain enough unreliable components and your system *will* fail.

SpecFlow embraces this truth. Instead of letting AI generate code freely, we force it through engineering discipline:

### The Eight-Phase Lifecycle

```
SPECIFY → PLAN → TASKS → IMPLEMENT → HARDEN → REVIEW → APPROVE → EVOLVE
```

| Phase | What Happens | Gate |
|-------|--------------|------|
| **SPECIFY** | Interview-driven requirements | Human approves spec |
| **PLAN** | Architecture decisions, data models | Human approves design |
| **TASKS** | Break work into reviewable units | Human approves breakdown |
| **IMPLEMENT** | TDD execution with verification | Tests pass, contracts verified |
| **HARDEN** | Generate acceptance tests, human fills & ingests results | All acceptance tests pass |
| **REVIEW** | Compile evidence into review package | Review package shows all green |
| **APPROVE** | Human reads review package, approves or rejects | Human approval |
| **EVOLVE** | Snapshot spec as baseline, transition to brownfield | Feature transitions to evolving |

**Each gate requires human approval.** The AI cannot skip ahead. No code gets written until the spec, plan, and tasks are complete. No feature ships until it survives hardening, review, and explicit approval.

### The Result

- **No hallucinated features** — everything traces back to approved specs
- **No forgotten context** — SQLite database tracks all features and progress
- **No mysterious breakage** — dependency tracking catches cascading failures
- **Resumable anytime** — interrupt and pick up exactly where you left off

> *The AI does the work. You provide direction and corrections.*

> **FOR AI AGENTS:** You are installing the SpecFlow Bundle into a PAI installation.
> Run the install wizard OR follow the manual installation steps below.
> Each package must be FULLY installed with ALL files. No shortcuts.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jcfischer/specflow-bundle.git
cd specflow-bundle

# Run the installer
bun run install.ts

# Or update an existing installation
bun run install.ts --update
```

---

## What's Included

| # | Package | Purpose |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | **SpecFlow** | Unified spec-driven workflow + CLI |
| 2 | **specflow-ui** | Progress dashboard |
| 3 | **pai-deps** | Dependency tracking |

---

## CRITICAL: Full Implementation Required

> **FOR AI AGENTS:** This section is mandatory. Do not skip or simplify.

### The Problem

AI agents systematically create "simplified" versions of installations, omitting files, shortening code, and creating broken setups. This is unacceptable.

### The Rules

1. **EVERY PACKAGE = FULL INSTALLATION** - All files must be copied
2. **EVERY FILE SPECIFIED = EVERY FILE CREATED** - No omissions
3. **EVERY DEPENDENCY = INSTALLED** - Run `bun install` for each package
4. **IF YOU CAN'T DO IT FULLY, STOP AND SAY SO** - Permission to refuse

---

## Manual Installation (For AI Agents)

If not using the install wizard, follow these steps exactly:

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Bun runtime installed (`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`)
- [ ] Claude Code installed (`~/.claude/` directory exists)
- [ ] Git with submodule support

### Step 1: Clone Repository

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jcfischer/specflow-bundle.git
cd specflow-bundle
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] `packages/specflow/` exists with files
- [ ] `packages/specflow-ui/` exists with files
- [ ] `packages/pai-deps/` exists with files (submodule)

### Step 2: Install SpecFlow Skill

```bash
cp -r packages/specflow ~/.claude/skills/SpecFlow
cd ~/.claude/skills/SpecFlow && bun install
```

**Verify SpecFlow installation:**
- [ ] `~/.claude/skills/SpecFlow/SKILL.md` exists

### Step 3: Install specflow-ui

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/specflow
cp -r packages/specflow-ui ~/.config/specflow/ui
cd ~/.config/specflow/ui && bun install
```

**Create launcher script:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cat > ~/.local/bin/specflow-ui << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
cd ~/.config/specflow/ui
exec bun run src/server.ts "$@"
EOF
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/specflow-ui
```

**Verify specflow-ui installation:**

- [ ] `~/.local/bin/specflow-ui` exists and is executable

### Step 4: Install pai-deps

```bash
cp -r packages/pai-deps ~/.config/specflow/pai-deps
cd ~/.config/specflow/pai-deps && bun install
```

**Create launcher script:**
```bash
cat > ~/.local/bin/pai-deps << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
cd ~/.config/specflow/pai-deps
exec bun run src/index.ts "$@"
EOF
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/pai-deps
```

**Verify pai-deps installation:**
- [ ] `~/.config/specflow/pai-deps/src/index.ts` exists
- [ ] `~/.config/specflow/pai-deps/node_modules/` exists (after bun install)
- [ ] `~/.local/bin/pai-deps` exists and is executable

### Step 5: Verify PATH

Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH:

```bash
echo $PATH | grep -q "$HOME/.local/bin" || echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## The Full Lifecycle

![SpecFlow Full Lifecycle](docs/specflow-full-lifecycle.png)

```
SPECIFY -> PLAN -> TASKS -> IMPLEMENT -> HARDEN -> REVIEW -> APPROVE -> EVOLVE
```

| Phase | What | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| **SPECIFY** | Define requirements, success criteria | `spec.md` |
| **PLAN** | Design architecture, data models | `plan.md` |
| **TASKS** | Break into reviewable units | `tasks.md` |
| **IMPLEMENT** | Build with TDD (RED->GREEN->BLUE) | Working code |
| **HARDEN** | Generate acceptance tests, human validates | `acceptance-test.md`, `results.json` |
| **REVIEW** | Compile evidence into review package | `review-package.md` |
| **APPROVE** | Human reads package, approves or rejects | Feature approved |
| **EVOLVE** | Snapshot spec as baseline, transition to brownfield | Baseline locked |

Each phase is **gated** - you cannot advance until the current phase is validated.

### Standalone Utilities

| Utility | What | Output |
|---------|------|--------|
| **contrib-prep** | Extract clean contribution from private trunk | Tagged contrib branch |
| **release** | 8-gate release readiness evaluation | `release-readiness.md` |
| **brownfield** | Iteration loop: scan, diff, apply | Updated specs |

### Brownfield Iteration (post-EVOLVE)

Once a feature reaches EVOLVE, it enters the brownfield iteration loop for continuous improvement:

```
EVOLVE -> brownfield scan -> brownfield diff -> brownfield apply -> SPECIFY (v2) -> ...
```

Brownfield iteration detects drift between the locked baseline spec and the current codebase, generating change proposals that feed back into a new SPECIFY cycle.

### Quality Gates

SpecFlow includes built-in quality evaluations using YAML rubrics scored by AI:

- **Spec Quality** - Validates specification completeness (8 weighted criteria)
- **Plan Quality** - Validates technical design and architecture decisions
- **Tasks Quality** - Validates task granularity, dependencies, test coverage, and phased organization
- Quality threshold: >= 80% to proceed

```bash
specflow eval run                    # Run all applicable evals
specflow eval run --rubric spec-quality  # Run specific rubric
```

## Collaborative Development with pai-collab

![SpecFlow + pai-collab Integration](docs/specflow-pai-collab-integration.png)

SpecFlow's `contrib-prep` command bridges private development with the [pai-collab](https://github.com/mellanon/pai-collab) shared ecosystem:

1. **Your Private Workspace** -- Develop features in your private trunk using the full SpecFlow workflow
2. **Contrib-Prep** -- Extract clean contributions through 5 human-approved gates (inventory, sanitize, extract, verify, approve)
3. **Shared Blackboard** -- Submit via fork + PR to the pai-collab coordination repo
4. **Review Pipeline** -- Automated checks, Maestro playbook review, community agents, human sign-off
5. **Ecosystem** -- Released contributions available to all operators via the Daemon Registry

> AI agents submit PRs like humans -- the operator is accountable. Fork model means no write access needed.

## Migration from Separate SpecKit

If you previously had SpecKit installed separately:

1. Remove the old SpecKit skill: `rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/SpecKit`
2. Install the updated SpecFlow (this bundle)
3. Update any references from `/speckit.*` commands to `specflow` CLI

| Old Command | New Command |
|-------------|-------------|
| `/speckit.specify` | `specflow specify F-N` |
| `/speckit.plan` | `specflow plan F-N` |
| `/speckit.tasks` | `specflow tasks F-N` |
| `/speckit.implement` | `specflow implement F-N` |
